Repo where I do random implementations and experiments that don't fit into a full repo


Initially I planned for this to be something to do hardware experimenations like with caches. But honestly, there are a lot of cool difficult things I want to implement so I'm going to coalesce some things that aren't big enough to be in a proejct here :)
